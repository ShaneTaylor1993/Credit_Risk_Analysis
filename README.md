# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Purpose
The purpose of this analysis was to apply maching learning techniques to predict credit risk. The goal was to create a more reliable loan experience as well as a more accurate identification of good loan candidates, which would then lead to lower default rates. Using a dataset from LendingClub, we oversampled the data using the RandomOversampler and SMOTE algorithms and undersampled the data using the ClusterCentroids algorithm. We then used a combination of both algortihms using the over-and-under algorithm, SMOTEENN. Next, we compare the two machine learning models, BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier, to predict credit risk. We then evaluate the performance of the models and reccomend which model should be used to predict credit risk.
